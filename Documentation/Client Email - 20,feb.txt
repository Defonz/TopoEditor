Dear Ryan

After todays meeting with Steve we have come 
up with a few points that we wanted to discuss.

- Are you wanting to start the database from scratch or have you already got 
	an image library from which users can then build up on?
- We have came up with a basic layout for the webpage and we wanted to have 
	your feedback on this as we recall you saying how important the usability
	of it was. (document attached) 
- We have also looked into the possible libraries we might use and we have come up 
	with a list:
		- jQuery 
		- OpenLayer (image layering)
		- Gallerie (image display)
	Do these seem suitable or did you have any other libraries you would like us to implement.

At this point we are hoping to have a basic working prototype for next week's session.
We are also starting to write up the use-case documentation and identify the possible 
testing strategies. If we could meet up at some point next week after we have had our
feedback on Monday that would be great, as we would like to have feedback from you too. 

Thanks

Emmanuel
